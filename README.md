# Blazed Past Us..

**Silver Surfer asked:**  
_"How fast can a dev blog go?"_

**Gas Git, intrigued, answered:**  
_"I don't know… shall we see?"_

**Silver Surfer looked dubious and curious:**  
_"Very well… let the cosmos bear witness."_

# Notes

- The post file name will be the title.
- There is no need to add the title within the .md file, this will be set by the meta data.
- Post tags are written in every post on the very top as `**tags:** tag1, tag2,...`
- The descriptions of the posts will be a brief showcase of the first paragraph (below the tags).
